    <p>I find myself here again, sitting in the latest high end, <span class="palette">trendy</span> restaurant that I cannot afford, among clusters of  <span class="kranky">hip New Yorkers</span> who waited weeks for this reservation. And I am listening. Listening as I have done for the last ten years. This time it’s the familiar story of how you quit another  <span class="unkempt">perfectly</span> good job because: <p>

<p><span class="press">a) you messed up</span><br>
<span class="henny">b) you can’t get along with other people</span><br>
<span class="cabin">c) you’re having a major personal crisis</span><br>
<span class="bangers">d) all of the above</span></p>
<p>Actually, all of your stories, whether related to work or relationships, have the same multiple-choice ending. And I listen because that’s what <span class="mountains">friends</span> do. Especially your friends, who are few and far-between. I listen to every painstaking detail of every moment. I nod in agreement as I sip my <span class="codystar">$20 cocktail</span>. I barely say anything and when I do, it goes unnoticed.</p>
<p><span class="press">Dinner</span> arrives, a plate of something lovely yet forgettable. And the listening continues. I really do want to say, “I completely <span class="henny">disagree</span> with the way you handled the situation, you messed up, what’s wrong with you?” But I can’t bring myself to confront you in your vulnerable state. And therein lies the problem: you are always in a <span class="cabin">vulnerable</span> state. It takes a lot of emotional and mental strength to be your friend. I am not strong. In fact, eating this dinner I feel  <span class="kranky">weak</span>, almost <span class="palette">nauseous</span>. Perhaps I am the vulnerable one and you the strong one. You must be strong in some sense to cope with your self-made <span class="unkempt">crises</span>. Yes, that’s it! I am too vulnerable to deal with you. I shouldn’t be here. I will <span class="codystar">not</span> allow myself to be put in this position again. The check arrives. It sickens me that I have to lay down my credit card because it’s my “turn” but I am comforted by the realization that this will be the <span class="bangers">last time</span>.</p>
